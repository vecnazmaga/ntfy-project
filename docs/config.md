# Configuring the ntfy server
The ntfy server can be configured in three ways: using a config file (typically at `/etc/ntfy/config.yml`, 
see [config.yml](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/blob/main/config/config.yml)), via command line arguments 
or using environment variables.

## Quick start
By default, simply running `ntfy` will start the server at port 80. No configuration needed. Batteries included ðŸ˜€. 
If everything works as it should, you'll see something like this:
```
$ ntfy                
2021/11/30 19:59:08 Listening on :80
```

You can immediately start [publishing messages](publish/index.md), or subscribe via the [Android app](subscribe/phone.md),
[the web UI](subscribe/web.md), or simply via [curl or your favorite HTTP client](subscribe/api.md). To configure 
the server further, check out the [config options table](#config-options) or simply type `ntfy --help` to
get a list of [command line options](#command-line-options).

## Config options
Each config options can be set in the config file `/etc/ntfy/config.yml` (e.g. `listen-http: :80`) or as a 
CLI option (e.g. `--listen-http :80`. Here's a list of all available options. Alternatively, you can set an environment
variable before running the `ntfy` command (e.g. `export NTFY_LISTEN_HTTP=:80`).

| Config option | Env variable | Format | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `listen-http` | `NTFY_LISTEN_HTTP` | `[host]:port` | `:80` | Listen address for the HTTP web server |
| `firebase-key-file` | `NTFY_FIREBASE_KEY_FILE` | *filename* | - | If set, also publish messages to a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) topic for your app. This is optional and only required to save battery when using the Android app. |
| `cache-file` | `NTFY_CACHE_FILE` | *filename* | - | If set, messages are cached in a local SQLite database instead of only in-memory. This allows for service restarts without losing messages in support of the since= parameter. |
| `cache-duration` | `NTFY_CACHE_DURATION` | *duration* | 12h | Duration for which messages will be buffered before they are deleted. This is required to support the `since=...` and `poll=1` parameter. |
| `keepalive-interval` | `NTFY_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL` | *duration* | 30s | Interval in which keepalive messages are sent to the client. This is to prevent intermediaries closing the connection for inactivity. Note that the Android app has a hardcoded timeout at 77s, so it should be less than that. |
| `manager-interval` | `$NTFY_MANAGER_INTERVAL` | *duration* | 1m | Interval in which the manager prunes old messages, deletes topics and prints the stats. |
| `global-topic-limit` | `NTFY_GLOBAL_TOPIC_LIMIT` | *number* | 5000 | Rate limiting: Total number of topics before the server rejects new topics. |
| `visitor-subscription-limit` | `NTFY_VISITOR_SUBSCRIPTION_LIMIT` | *number* | 30 | Rate limiting: Number of subscriptions per visitor (IP address) |
| `visitor-request-limit-burst` | `NTFY_VISITOR_REQUEST_LIMIT_BURST` | *number* | 60 | Allowed GET/PUT/POST requests per second, per visitor. This setting is the initial bucket of requests each visitor has |
| `visitor-request-limit-replenish` | `NTFY_VISITOR_REQUEST_LIMIT_REPLENISH` | *duration* | 10s | Strongly related to `visitor-request-limit-burst`: The rate at which the bucket is refilled |
| `behind-proxy` | `NTFY_BEHIND_PROXY` | *bool* | false | If set, the X-Forwarded-For header is used to determine the visitor IP address instead of the remote address of the connection. |

The format for a *duration* is: `<number>(smh)`, e.g. 30s, 20m or 1h.

## Firebase (FCM)
!!! info
    Using Firebase is **optional** and only works if you modify and build your own Android .apk.
    For a self-hosted instance, it's easier to just not bother with FCM.

[Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) is the Google approved way to send
push messages to Android devices. FCM is the only method that an Android app can receive messages without having to run a
[foreground service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services). 

For the main host [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh), the [ntfy Android App](subscribe/phone.md) uses Firebase to send messages
to the device. For other hosts, instant delivery is used and FCM is not involved.

To configure FCM for your self-hosted instance of the ntfy server, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a [Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create an app and download the key file (e.g. `myapp-firebase-adminsdk-ahnce-....json`)
3. Place the key file in `/etc/ntfy`, set the `firebase-key-file` in `config.yml` accordingly and restart the ntfy server
4. Build your own Android .apk following [these instructions]()

Example:
```
# If set, also publish messages to a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) topic for your app.
# This is optional and only required to support Android apps (which don't allow background services anymore).
#
firebase-key-file: "/etc/ntfy/ntfy-sh-firebase-adminsdk-ahnce-9f4d6f14b5.json"
```

## Behind a proxy (TLS, etc.)

!!! warning
    If you are behind a proxy, you must set the `behind-proxy` flag. Otherwise all visitors are rate limited
    as if they are one.

**TLS/SSL*: ntfy does not support TLS at this time. 

If you are running ntfy behind a proxy (e.g. nginx, HAproxy or Apache), you should set the `behind-proxy` flag. This will
instruct the [rate limiting](#rate-limiting) logic to use the `X-Forwarded-For` header as the primary identifier 


## Rate limiting
Rate limiting: Allowed GET/PUT/POST requests per second, per visitor:
- visitor-request-limit-burst is the initial bucket of requests each visitor has
- visitor-request-limit-replenish is the rate at which the bucket is refilled
