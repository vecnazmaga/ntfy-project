# ntfy.sh | simple HTTP-based pub-sub

**ntfy** (pronounce: *notify*) is a simple HTTP-based [pub-sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)
notification service. It allows you to send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts from any computer,
entirely **without signup, cost or setup**. It's also [open source](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy) if you want 
to run your own.
