# Getting started

**ntfy** (pronounce: *notify*) is a simple HTTP-based [pub-sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)
notification service. It allows you to **send push notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts from any computer**,
entirely **without signup, cost or setup**. It's [open source](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy) if you want to run your own.
