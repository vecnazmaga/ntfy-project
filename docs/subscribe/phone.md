# Subscribe from your phone
You can use the [ntfy Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy) to receive 
notifications directly on your phone. Just like the server, this app is also [open source](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-android).
Since I don't have an iPhone or a Mac, I didn't make an iOS app yet. I'd be awesome if [someone else could help out](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/4).
