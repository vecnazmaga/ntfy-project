# Subscribe from your phone
You can use the [ntfy Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy) to receive 
notifications directly on your phone. Just like the server, this app is also [open source](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-android).
Since I don't have an iPhone or a Mac, I didn't make an iOS app yet. I'd be awesome if [someone else could help out](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/4).

## Android
You can get the Android app from both [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy) and 
from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/). Both are largely identical, with the one exception that
the F-Droid flavor does not use Firebase.

### Firebase + Instant delivery



## iPhone/iOS
I almost feel devious for putting the *Download on the App Store* button on this page. Currently, there is no iOS app
for ntfy, but it's in the works. You can track the status on GitHub.
