# Subscribe from the Web UI
You can use the Web UI to subscribe to topics as well. If you do, and you keep the website open, **notifications will
pop up as desktop notifications**. Simply type in the topic name and click the *Subscribe* button. The browser will 
keep a connection open and listen for incoming notifications.

To learn how to send messages, check out the [publishing page](../publish.md).
