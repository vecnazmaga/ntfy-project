# Privacy policy

I love free software, and I'm doing this because it's fun. I have no bad intentions, and I will
never monetize or sell your information. This service will always stay free and open.

Neither the server nor the app record any personal information, or share any of the messages and topics with
any outside service. All data is exclusively used to make the service function properly. The only external service
I use is Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service, which is required to provide instant Android notifications (see
[FAQ](faq.md) for details). To avoid FCM altogether, download the F-Droid version.

The web server does not log or otherwise store request paths, remote IP addresses or even topics or messages,
aside from a short on-disk cache to support service restarts.
