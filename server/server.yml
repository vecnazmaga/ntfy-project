# ntfy server config file

# Public facing base URL of the service (e.g. https://ntfy.sh or https://ntfy.example.com)
# This setting is currently only used by the e-mail sending feature (outgoing mail only).
#
# base-url:

# Listen address for the HTTP & HTTPS web server. If "listen-https" is set, you must also
# set "key-file" and "cert-file". Format: <hostname>:<port>
#
# listen-http: ":80"
# listen-https:

# Path to the private key & cert file for the HTTPS web server. Not used if "listen-https" is not set.
#
# key-file:
# cert-file:

# If set, also publish messages to a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) topic for your app.
# This is optional and only required to save battery when using the Android app.
#
# firebase-key-file: <filename>

# If set, messages are cached in a local SQLite database instead of only in-memory. This
# allows for service restarts without losing messages in support of the since= parameter.
#
# To disable the cache entirely (on-disk/in-memory), set "cache-duration" to 0.
#
# Note: If you are running ntfy with systemd, make sure this cache file is owned by the
#       ntfy user and group by running: chown ntfy.ntfy <filename>.
#
# cache-file: <filename>

# Duration for which messages will be buffered before they are deleted.
# This is required to support the "since=..." and "poll=1" parameter.
#
# You can disable the cache entirely by setting this to 0.
#
# cache-duration: 12h

# If set, the X-Forwarded-For header is used to determine the visitor IP address
# instead of the remote address of the connection.
#
# WARNING: If you are behind a proxy, you must set this, otherwise all visitors are rate limited
#          as if they are one.
#
# behind-proxy: false

# If enabled, allow outgoing e-mail notifications via the 'X-Email' header. If this header is set,
# messages will additionally be sent out as e-mail using an external SMTP server. As of today, only
# SMTP servers with plain text auth and STARTLS are supported. Please also refer to the rate limiting settings
# below (visitor-email-limit-burst & visitor-email-limit-burst).
#
# - smtp-sender-addr is the hostname:port of the SMTP server
# - smtp-sender-user/smtp-sender-pass are the username and password of the SMTP user
# - smtp-sender-from is the e-mail address of the sender
#
# smtp-sender-addr:
# smtp-sender-user:
# smtp-sender-pass:
# smtp-sender-from:

# If enabled, ntfy will launch a lightweight SMTP server for incoming messages. Once configured, users can send
# emails to a topic e-mail address to publish messages to a topic.
#
# - smtp-server-listen defines the IP address and port the SMTP server will listen on, e.g. :25 or 1.2.3.4:25
# - smtp-server-domain is the e-mail domain, e.g. ntfy.sh
# - smtp-server-addr-prefix is an optional prefix for the e-mail addresses to prevent spam. If set to "ntfy-",
#   for instance, only e-mails to ntfy-$topic@ntfy.sh will be accepted. If this is not set, all emails to
#   $topic@ntfy.sh will be accepted (which may obviously be a spam problem).

# Interval in which keepalive messages are sent to the client. This is to prevent
# intermediaries closing the connection for inactivity.
#
# Note that the Android app has a hardcoded timeout at 77s, so it should be less than that.

# keepalive-interval: 30s

# Interval in which the manager prunes old messages, deletes topics

# Rate limiting: Total number of topics before the server rejects new topics.

# Rate limiting: Number of subscriptions per visitor (IP address)
#
# visitor-subscription-limit: 30

# Rate limiting: Allowed GET/PUT/POST requests per second, per visitor:
# - visitor-request-limit-burst is the initial bucket of requests each visitor has
# - visitor-request-limit-replenish is the rate at which the bucket is refilled
#
# visitor-request-limit-burst: 60
# visitor-request-limit-replenish: 10s

# Rate limiting: Allowed emails per visitor:
# - visitor-email-limit-burst is the initial bucket of emails each visitor has
# - visitor-email-limit-replenish is the rate at which the bucket is refilled
