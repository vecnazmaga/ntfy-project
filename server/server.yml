# ntfy server config file

# Listen address for the HTTP & HTTPS web server. If "listen-https" is set, you must also
# set "key-file" and "cert-file".
# Format: <hostname>:<port>
#
# listen-http: ":80"
# listen-https:

# Path to the private key & cert file for the HTTPS web server. Not used if "listen-https" is not set.

# If set, also publish messages to a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) topic for your app.
# This is optional and only required to save battery when using the Android app.
#
# firebase-key-file: <filename>

# If set, messages are cached in a local SQLite database instead of only in-memory. This
# allows for service restarts without losing messages in support of the since= parameter.
#
# To disable the cache entirely (on-disk/in-memory), set "cache-duration" to 0.
#
# Note: If you are running ntfy with systemd, make sure this cache file is owned by the
#       ntfy user and group by running: chown ntfy.ntfy <filename>.
#
# cache-file: <filename>

# Duration for which messages will be buffered before they are deleted.
# This is required to support the "since=..." and "poll=1" parameter.
#
# You can disable the cache entirely by setting this to 0.
#
# cache-duration: 12h

# Interval in which keepalive messages are sent to the client. This is to prevent
# intermediaries closing the connection for inactivity.
#
# Note that the Android app has a hardcoded timeout at 77s, so it should be less than that.
#
# keepalive-interval: 30s

# Interval in which the manager prunes old messages, deletes topics
# and prints the stats.
#
# manager-interval: 1m

# Rate limiting: Total number of topics before the server rejects new topics.
#
# global-topic-limit: 5000

# Rate limiting: Number of subscriptions per visitor (IP address)
#
# visitor-subscription-limit: 30

# Rate limiting: Allowed GET/PUT/POST requests per second, per visitor:
# - visitor-request-limit-burst is the initial bucket of requests each visitor has
# - visitor-request-limit-replenish is the rate at which the bucket is refilled
#
# visitor-request-limit-burst: 60
# visitor-request-limit-replenish: 10s

# Rate limiting: Allowed emails per visitor:
# - visitor-email-limit-burst is the initial bucket of emails each visitor has
# - visitor-email-limit-replenish is the rate at which the bucket is refilled
#
# visitor-email-limit-burst: 16
# visitor-email-limit-replenish: 1h

# If set, the X-Forwarded-For header is used to determine the visitor IP address
# instead of the remote address of the connection.
#
# WARNING: If you are behind a proxy, you must set this, otherwise all visitors are rate limited
#          as if they are one.
